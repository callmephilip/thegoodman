# about
**Hello.** This project is about experimentations.
About CSS3 animations and a graduation project.
My name is *Pedro Ivo Hudson* and this is my debut.

**The Good Man** is about visual transcription of a narrative.
Transformed into HTML elements and animated in CSS3, this project aims its efforts to build an animation, in a web browser.

**Without images**, just Unicode characters and shapes, it’s intended to run smoothly in modern web browsers and to be as *scalable* as possible.

**Also**, this is my graduation project. I’m majoring in Graphic Design.
If you’d like to talk, *get in touch*:
