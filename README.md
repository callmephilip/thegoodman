# The Good Man
www.thegoodman.cc

*Hello.* This project is about experimentations.<br>
About CSS3 animations and a graduation project.<br>
My name is **Pedro Ivo Hudson** and this is my debut.

**The Good Man** is about visual transcription of a narrative.<br>
Transformed into HTML elements and animated in CSS3, this project aims its efforts to build an *animation*, in a web browser.

**Without images**, just web fonts and shapes, it’s intended to run smoothly and to be as *scalable* as possible.

Also, this is my graduation project in Graphic Design.

I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I did coding it!
