The Good Man, by Husky Rescue

I am the superman <br>
The great enemy of evil <br>
I fight for goodness <br>
Fight for what's right <br>
The superman <br>
With superpowers <br>
The super good <br>
Against bad behavior

I've always been a superman <br>
When I was a boy <br>
I wanted to be a fireman <br>
Run through the flames with my super helmet <br>
Pump up water and fight the fire <br>
Hot flames and evil smoke <br>
Smash things up with a big hammer <br>
And rescue all the good people <br>
The proper citizens

I wanted to make my mom proud of me <br>
She was my superwoman <br>
I wanted to be a doctor <br>
Fight against diseases with my knowledge <br>
Make my mom immortal <br>
Help everybody who was in trouble or feeling bad

I wanted to be an officer <br>
A policeman with a blue uniform <br>
Put bad people into jail and keep crime off the streets <br>
Chase gangsters with my super car <br>
And shoot them up with my bullets

I wanted to be a great man <br>
Like my father <br>
The good man <br>
Taking care of his loving family <br>
Wife and son <br>
Coming home everyday after work and read a newspaper <br>
Build a house in the countryside I'd go fishing

Now I got it all <br>
Well, my wife doesn't love me anymore <br>
But that's ok <br>
I've got the other plans already <br>
I have it all figured out <br>
I am the superman <br>
Fight against the bad

One day <br>
I'll fly away <br>
Like a butterfly <br>
High up into the sky <br>
And I'll touch the sun
